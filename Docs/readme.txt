The NOn-STationary RAndom field model (NoStRa).

The R package NoStRa allows one to carry out numerical experiments with the 
Doubly Stochastic Advection-Diffusion-Decay Model.

The model is described in the paper
"A doubly stochastic advection-diffusion-decay model for testing  data assimilation methodologies"
by Michael Tsyrulnikov and Alexander Rakitko
(to be submited to Quart. J. Roy. Meteorol. Soc.)

With this R package, one can reproduce all the results reported in the paper.

The paper proposes a new doubly stochastic advection-diffusion-decay model defined on the 1D
spatial domain (the circle).
It is intended to be used in testing and developing data assimilation methodologies
as well as in a broader context of non-stationary spatio-temporal random field modeling.
The model is hierarchical: it is a stochastic (forced by the white noise) 
partial differential equation whose coefficients are 
spatio-temporal random fields by themselves
satisfying their own stochastic partial differential equations  with constant coefficients.
The solution to the model has complex spatio-temporal covariances
with the tunable degree of non-stationarity in space-time.
Another important feature of the  model is that it allows the
estimation of ``true'' space and time specific spatio-temporal covariances: 
both the signal covariances and
the error covariances for any filter in question. 
This provides the researcher not only with the true state, 
as in the Observing Systems Simulation Experiments (OSSE) methodology,
but also with the true field and error ``covariances of the day''.
The capabilities of the  doubly stochastic model are illustrated 
in numerical experiments with the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF).

It is shown that the accuracy of the forecast-ensemble sample covariance matrix
can be substantially improved by  its temporal smoothing.

Manual

1. In folder Generator:

a) edit config.txt
b) execute  generate_fields.R

The output will be:

If in config.txt,
compute_field_true_covs=1,
then the output file model.RData will be created in 
Generator/Out.

If in config.txt,
perform_enkf=1, 
then the  output file filter.RData will be created in 
Generator/Out.

If in config.txt,
compute_field_true_covs=-1  and  perform_enkf=-1, 
then the  output file fields_long.RData will be created in 
Generator/Out.
This option is intended to be used with M=1 to generate
a realization of the field xi for a long time (e.g. 60000 time steps).


2. Move the file Generator/Out/fields_long.RData to folder 
Statistics/Fields_long.
Then, in folder Statistics/Fields_long, 
execute the script Exam_fields_long.R.
-> Plots with time asnd space xi correlation functions will be created.
   kurtosis(xi) will be evaluated and written to the file out_xi_all.txt.


3. Move the file Generator/Out/model.RData to folder 
Statistics/NstatioFieldCovs.
Then, in folder Statistics/NstatioFieldCovs, 
execute the script ExamDSMoutput.R.
-> Plots with the secondary fields and xi will be created 
   as well as plots with randomly chosen spatial field correlations.

4. Move the file Generator/Out/filter.RData to folder 
Statistics/Statistics/EnKF-covs.
Then, in folder EnKF-covs, execute the script ExamEnKFcovs.R.
-> Various plots related to the EnKF's prior covariances will be created.
